# DeepHealth Winter School 2022

Intense week in which the combination of lectures and lab exercises
will bring participants (1) closer to the use of deep learning and
computer vision in tasks related to medical imaging and other
medical data, and (2) to high-performance computing to considerably
reduce the running times of model-training processes.

From [here](figures/DHWS-flyer.pdf) you can download the flyer to distributed it everywhere (thanks in advance).

The DeepHealth Winter School will include theoretical sessions (master classes)
about the above enumerated four topics, and lab sessions to show attendants
how the software created in the DeepHealth project can be installed and used.

Lab exercises will be guided by junior and senior researchers involved in the DeepHealth project.

### Lab sessions

Lab sessions are open to all registered people (i.e., even for those who registered for **master classes only**),
i.e., all attendees can run the non-distributed experiments in their own computers if equipped with one GPU at least.
User accounts to run experiments by distributing the workload on HPC infrastructures will be created only for 10
working of groups of 5 people comming from the 50 attendees registered in the lab sessions.

Before the lab exercises, as the starting point of the lab sessions, we have an introduction to the
[ECVL & EDDL environment for potential developers](lab/00_ecvl_eddl_environment),
scheduled ***Monday afternoon from 3 PM to 5 PM***, and consisting in a 
**presentation and brief explanation of the main features of both ECVL and EDDL libraries**.

Then we will continue with [the sessions to carry out the lab exercises](lab).
