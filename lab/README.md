# DeepHealth Winter School 2021
## Lab exercises

1. [Installation and configuration of ECVL & EDDL](01_installation)

    Monday afternoon from 5 PM to 6 PM.

    The lab team will remain available till 7 PM in order to assist attendees to complete the installation on their own computers
    (laptop or desktop with at least one GPU card. With no GPU cards it is not feasible to run the lab exercises scheduled for
    the next lab sessions).

    **IMPORTANT NOTICE**: due to the time required to download and install
    (i) [Anaconda for Python 3](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual),
    (ii) the required packages when configuring the `winter-school` environment, and
    (iii) to install both ECVL and EDDL libraries,
    we suggest attendees to try the installation some days before the winter school
    by following the [same guide](https://github.com/deephealthproject/winter-school/tree/main/lab/01_installation)
    we will use during this session.


2. Lab exercises to be run in non-distributed mode using datasets from several DeepHealth use cases

    Tuesday afternoon from 4:30 PM till 6 PM, and Wednesday morning from 9 AM till 11:30 AM.

    Additionally to the use of the computing infrastructure made available by UNITO to a maximum of 10 user accounts,
    it will be feasible to run these lab exercises in non-distributed mode on attendees computers equiped with one GPU card at least.

    Each use case will be explained in the following order using the correspoding slides and the guide:
        
    1. [Use case 15 based on X-ray images from COVID-19 patients and controls](02_uc15_based_examples)

    2. [Use case 12 based on RGB images from skin to classify and segment skin cancer spots](03_uc12_based_examples)

    3. [Use case 13 based on EEG raw signals to detect epileptic seizures](04_uc13_based_examples)

    **IMPORTANT NOTICE**: due to the time required to download datasets, we suggest attenddes to start to download all the datasets
    referenced in the three lab exercises the week before the winter school starts.

3. Lab exercises to be run in distributed mode using datassets from several DeepHealth use cases and running on a HPC environment

    Thursday morning from 9 AM till 1:30 PM.

    Details to be added soon.
